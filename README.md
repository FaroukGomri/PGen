# PGen - Password Generator

PGen is a secure, privacy-first password generator that creates strong, unique passwords deterministically based on your personal seed phrase. No data is stored or transmitted.

> **Inspired by my earlier Python password generator project:**  
> [password-generator (Python)](https://github.com/FaroukGomri/password-generator)  
> This Python script generates strong, reproducible passwords from a user-defined seed using a combination of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and punctuation.  
> The web-based PGen project builds upon this idea, providing a user-friendly browser interface and enhanced security through deterministic JavaScript algorithms.

## Features

- Deterministic password generation from your seed phrase.
- Generates 32-character strong passwords including uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols.
